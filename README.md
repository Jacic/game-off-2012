Move the clones by using the arrow keys or WASD keys. Press keys 1-6 to create a new clone, or if that number clone already exists, switch control to it. Press Enter when the needed number of clones are on a teleporter to move on to the next level. If you get stuck, press R to restart.

This is mostly just a prototype in its current state, but I plan to continue improving it and turn it into a full game.

Thanks for taking a look at this game! :)
